# Group 8 Data Science Applications Clustering Assignment Project 2
A simple and well designed structure is essential for any machine learning project, project template that combines **simplicity, best practice for CODE structure** and **good CODE design**. 
The main idea is that there's much same stuff you do every time when you start our machine learning project, so wrapping all this shared stuff will help you to change just the core idea every time you start our machine learning project. 

**So, here’s a simple readme template that help you get into our project faster and just focus on your notice and explainations, etc)**

In order to decrease repeated code shunks, increase the time that can read the code in, flexibility an reusability we used a functional programming structure that focused on split all problems in our project in functions and use that functions many times in many places in the code without repeating the code.

# Run the Code
- Upload the ipynb code file into "Google Colab" or Anaconda "Jupyter Notebook"
- Press "Run All" in the control panel or "Restart Kernel and Run All" to run all code 
- In case of run each code cell alone, press the run button that appear at each code cell
